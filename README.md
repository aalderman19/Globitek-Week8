# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration						 - 
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)	 - 
* SQL Injection (SQLi)						 - 
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)				 - IN GREEN
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)			 - 
* Session Hijacking/Fixation				 - 

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: __________________

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Green

Vulnerability #1: XSS - The user can submit feedback that when accessed from the admin side, will run code in a script tag. The other sites probably escape the strings that the users can submit feedback for.
